            University bar - Scrollbar - at IT-University of Copenhagen. I
            became a bartender to get to know more people from across the
            different programs at the University. I learned a lot about what it
            means to have fun at the job while creating core connections with a
            ton of nice friends.

          <h6>One-time pay</h6>
          <p>
            The IT-University of Copenhagen receive a small amount of exchange
            students each semester. After my time studying abroad myself, I
            decided to become a tutor for the exchange students coming to my
            University. My task was for one day to prepare material regarding
            what it is like studying at ITU and in Denmark in general. It was
            also my job to make them feel comfortable and get to know each other
            through games.
            <br />
            If I remember correctly I have done it each semester since summer
            2023.

          <h6>Bar co-founder</h6>
          <p>
            Along with two of my great friends from the dorm room I live at, we
            re-founded the bar. The bar was originally created by another dorm
            resident, but after the person moved out the bar stagnated.
            <br />
            After a year us three decided to re-found the bar, as the original
            founder had a lot of money in the bar. However, after half a year of
            hard work and many parties, we had paid off the debt (around
            5.000dkk) and revived the bar. I stood for handling practical work,
            shift schedules, bartending, teaching new tenders, and promoting.

          <h6>Member of different committees</h6>
          <p>
            During my time I have been a big part of many committees and clubs.
            Party committee, resident board member, founder of football club,
            and several christmas/easter lunches.

          <h6>Work with DIS</h6>
          <p>
            The owners of the dorm, DIS, lets residents work for them during
            semester arrival of students and other smaller jobs to help the
            exchange students feel comfortable in Denmark and learn about our
            country.

          <p>
            My job was to walk come in at least once a week to walk the dogs or
            just socialize with them. My shifts weren't much longer than 4 hours
            a day. But it was still the highlight of my week. I had to stop,
            since I started school and driving lessons, so I did not have the
            time to go every week, which was a requirement.

          <h6>Intern - Canada</h6>
          <p>
            During my stay I was involved with animal care, management and
            rehabilitation. I cared for juvenile and adult Raccoons, adult
            Skunks and adult Douglas Squirrels. I was involved in medicating
            injured mammals and providing creative forms of enrichment for the
            animals. I gained experience observing behaviors of signs of injury
            on the animals, and providing wound care. I also worked with
            day-to-day cleaning, laundry and yard work.
