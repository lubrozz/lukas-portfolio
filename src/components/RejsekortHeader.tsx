        This page was made for my turn in my dorm rooms <i>Tour de Chambre</i>{" "}
        where the theme of the room was the Danish metro. I printed out some
        check in/out stands and gave everyone a printed travel card to use. The
        drink of the room was a layered shot of limoncello and sambuca to
        represent the M1 metro line. On my TV I put on a video of a front-seat
        ride of the M1 from start to finish as people were chatting. I then
        opened up this page and when around to each person, tapped the "Scan
        Rejsekort". If it came up red, they would have to take another shot.
